\begin{enumerate}
\item $\square\lozenge (x>10)$: \emph{infinitely often ($x>10$)} is not a safety property, because there exists no finite prefix after which the infinite word could not still become accepting. \\ It is a liveness property, because it expresses that the desired property ($x>10$) will occur infinitely often in the future in an $\omega$-word.
\item $\lnot(\square\lozenge (x>10))$: \emph{not infinitely often ($x>10$)} is also not a safety property because independent of the finite prefix, there exists an infinite suffix not containing any ($x>10$), which will satisfy the property. \\ It is hence a liveness property, with the desirable event being the occurrence of a last point in time where ($x>10$), such that only finitely many times exist where ($x>10$).
\item $\lozenge(x>10)$: \emph{eventually ($x>10$)} is not a safety property, because there exists no finite prefix such that the infinite part cannot contain ($x>10$), thus satisfying the property. \\ It is a liveness property, with two possibilities to satisfy it: Either ($x>10$) already happens in any finite prefix, or there exists one infinite $x_\omega \in \Sigma^\omega$ in which, at some point in time,  ($x>10$).
\item $\lnot(\lozenge (x>10))$: \emph{not eventually ($x>10$)} is a safety property, because for the finite prefix containing ($x>10$), whatever happens afterwards will no longer satisfy the property. \\ Since it is a safety property ($\neq \Sigma*$), it cannot be a liveness property.
